# Frame Data Trainer

Frame Data Trainer, FDT for short, is an application that teaches players frame data for T7. Referencing frame data and really knowing frame data are quite different. FDT allows players to turn that information into knowledge.

Focused and deliberate practice makes perfect. Test yourself by playing a round with the trainer. After each round, you receive feedback on exactly where you succeeded and where you fell short. You can even view your progress over time on the User Stats page.

This project is unfinished and still being developed. Currently, this is a one man operation, so understand that progress will be slow and steady. If you have any critiques, comments, or requests, I encourage you to reach out.
